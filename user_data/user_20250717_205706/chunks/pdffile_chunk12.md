MICROCONTROLLERS MADE EASY

Output Compare. Output Compare can time an external event by sending a value stored in- side the output compare register.

2.2 DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSORS (DSP)

Microcontrollers react to and control events, whereas DSPs execute repetitive math-intensive algorithms. Today many embedded applications require both types of processors, and semi- conductor manufacturers have responded by introducing microcontrollers with on-chip DSP capability and DSPs with on-chip microcontrollers.

The most basic thing a DSP will do is a MACC (Multiply and ACCumulate). The number of data bits a DSP can Multiply and ACCumulate will determine the dynamic range (and there- fore the application).
