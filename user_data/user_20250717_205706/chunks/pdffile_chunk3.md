Flash

Flash is an electrically erasable and programmable memory. It can be used instead of ROM to store program instructions and data. A key parameter of Flash memory is its endurance or the number of times it can be erased or reprogrammed. Depending on the technology used, flash endurance can be either 100 or 300,000 program/erase cycles.

RAM (Random Access Memory)

During in the execution of a program, data have to be saved for later use. Data are usually stored in RAM.

EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)

There is another way to store data in a microcontroller: EEPROM is used to store data that must be saved through a power down cycle.

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
