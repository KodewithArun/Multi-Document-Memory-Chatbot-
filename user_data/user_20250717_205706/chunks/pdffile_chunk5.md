I / O (INPUT / OUTPUT) PORTS

Most microcontrollers have several digital I/O ports that are used to drive a LED or get a key- board input. Usually, a port consists of eight or less bits, usually programmable as either input or output bits.

SERIAL INTERFACE

Serial interface are used to exchange data with the external world. Many microcontrollers have both asynchronous and synchronous communications peripherals built in. Usually, an asynchronous interface is called a serial communication interface (SCI or UART) while the synchronous interface is called a serial peripheral interface (SPI). A typical SCI application is to connect a PC for debugging purpose while a typical SPI application is to connect an ex- ternal EEPROM.
