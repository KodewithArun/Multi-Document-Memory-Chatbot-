While microprocessors target the maximum processing performance, the purpose of micro- controllers is to implement a set of control function in the most cost effective way. Although controlling a microwave oven with a Pentium(TM) might seem an attractive idea, it can be easily accomplished with an ST6. In a typical application, the MCU has to manage several tasks according to their priority or to the occurrence of external events (new command send by the keyboard, external temperature rise,...)
