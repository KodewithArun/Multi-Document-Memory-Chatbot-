Analog to digital conversion (A / D). Converts an external analog signal (typically relative to voltage) and converts it to a digital representation. Microcontrollers that have this feature can be used for instrumentation, environmental data logging, or any application that lives in an an- alog world. Various types of A/D converters that can be found.

Comparator. One or more standard comparators can sometimes be placed on a microcon- troller die. These comparators operate much like standard comparators however the input and output signals are available on the microcontroller bus.

Digital to analog conversion (D/A). This feature takes a Digital number and converts it to a analog output. The number 50 would be changed to the analog output of (50 / 256 * 5 Volts) = .9765625 V on a 8 bit / 5 Volt system.
