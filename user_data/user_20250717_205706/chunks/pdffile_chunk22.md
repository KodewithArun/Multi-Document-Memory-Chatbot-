1) The amount of power they dissipate is proportional to their size. If you make a transistor half as big, it dissipates half as much power.

2) Their propagation delay is proportional to their size. If you make a transistor half as big, itâ€™s twice as fast.

3) Their cost is proportional to the square of their size. If you make them half as big, they cost one quarter as much.

For years people have been using 5 Volts to power integrated circuits. Because the transistors were large, there was little danger damaging the transistor putting this voltage across it. How- ever, now that the transistors are getting so small, 5 Volts would now destroy them. The only way around this is to start lowering the voltage. This is also why people are now using 3 (ac- tually 3.3) Volt logic, and this will certainly lead to lower voltages in the next few years.
