2.3 ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNALS

We live in an analog world where the information we see, hear, process, and exchange with each other, and with our mechanical and electronic systems, is always an analog quantity: pressure, temperature, voltage and current are always analog entities. They can be digitized for more efficient storage and transmission, but the interface (input and output) is almost al- ways analog. Thus the essence of analog electronics lies in sensing continuously varying in- formation, converting it to digital and reshaping the digital data to an analog signal at the other end. Mixed analog-digital devices are being used increasingly to integrate the complex func- tions of high-speed telecommunications, or the real-time data processing demanded by indus- trial control systems and automotive systems.
