MICROCONTROLLERS MADE EASY

3 POWER SUPPLY ISSUES IN MCUs

Since automotive applications have been the driving force behind most microcontrollers, and 5 Volts was very easy to do in a car, most microcontrollers only supported 4.5 - 5.5 V opera- tion. In the recent past, as consumer goods were beginning to drive major segments of the mi- crocontroller market, and became portable and lightweight, the requirement for 3 volt (and lower) microcontrollers became urgent. 3 volts means 2 battery solution, lower voltage and longer battery life. Most low voltage parts in the market today are simply 5 volt parts that were modified to operate at 3 volts (usually at a performance loss). Some micros being released now are designed from the ground up to operate properly at 3.0 (and lower) voltages, which offer a performance level comparable to 5 volt devices.

But why are voltages going down on ICs? There are a few interesting rules of thumb regarding transistors:
