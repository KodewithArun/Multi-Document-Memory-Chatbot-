### How It Makes E-Commerce Better:
- **Access Anytime, Anywhere:** Customers can shop 24/7 from any location (home, work, or while traveling) using a phone or computer, without needing to visit a physical store.
- **Convenience for Customers:** No need to travel or wait for store hours, making shopping faster and easier.
- **Global Reach for Businesses:** Businesses can sell to customers worldwide, not just those near a physical store.

**Example:** You can order groceries from an app like Instacart at midnight, while a traditional store might be closed.
