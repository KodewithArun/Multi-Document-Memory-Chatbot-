# Drawbacks of M-Commerce

1. **Lack of GPS**: Non-GPS devices limit location-based services, reducing targeted sales.
2. **Accuracy Issues**: Inaccurate location data (e.g., 1500 ft vs. 10 ft) misleads offers, frustrating users.
3. **Cost Concerns**: High app development costs may not justify benefits.
4. **Bandwidth Limits**: Slow networks cause app issues, leading to lost sales.
5. **Privacy Fears**: Users avoid sharing data, reducing engagement.
6. **Security Risks**: Hacking/phishing deter mobile payments, impacting trust.
7. **Small Screens**: Poor navigation on small screens causes cart abandonment.
8. **Integration Challenges**: Syncing with existing systems is complex/expensive.
9. **User Resistance**: Low adoption in rural/older demographics limits reach.
