## Slide 4
AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
Examples: decision-making, language understanding, vision, robotics.
Real-world examples: ChatGPT, self-driving cars, chess engines, recommandation systems.

What is Artificial Intellegence ?

## Slide 5
ML is a subset of AI where systems learn from data and experience instead of being explicitly programmed.
Example: spam detection learns from past emails.

What is Machine Learning ?

## Slide 6
It is a field under focused on human language.
Examples: chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis.

What is Natural Language Processing ?

## Slide 9
What exactly is AI Model ? How does it learn ?

<number>

An AI model is made up of math and numbers that help it make decisions.
Inside a model, it has Inputs (what we give it), Weights (how important each input is), Rules (math formulas to process the inputs) and Outputs (the result or prediction).
Models try to make predictions.
They calculate the error between prediction and actual value.
The model adjusts it’s weights to reduce this error (training).

## Slide 12
Representation: Language needs to be converted into numbers.
Ambiguity: Words can have multiple meanings 
Context Understanding: Same sentence can mean different things in different situations.	
Sarcasm & Emotion: Hard for machines to detect tone, irony, or feelings.
Grammar & Syntax Variability: People don’t always follow rules when speaking or typing.
Multilingual & Code-Switching: People use many languages or mix them in a sentence.
Data Noise: Real-world text (social media, chat) is messy and unstructured.
