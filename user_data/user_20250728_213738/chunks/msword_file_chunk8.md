# M-Commerce: Definition, Benefits, and Drawbacks

M-Commerce (Mobile Commerce) refers to the buying and selling of goods and services through wireless handheld devices like smartphones and tablets. It is a subset of e-commerce, enabling users to shop, pay, or conduct transactions anytime, anywhere via mobile apps or mobile-optimized websites.

M-commerce was coined in 1997 by Kevin Duffey as "the delivery of electronic commerce capabilities directly into the consumerâ€™s hand, anywhere, via wireless technology." It relies on mobile applications and is enhanced by advancements like 4G/5G networks, GPS, and widespread smartphone use.
