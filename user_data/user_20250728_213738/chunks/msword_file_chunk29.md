## Comparison to Traditional Commerce
- Traditional stores rely on physical displays, limited signage, or staff explanations, which may not provide as much detail or interactivity.
- In-store experiences lack personalization (e.g., a salesperson can’t instantly recommend products based on your past purchases).
- Traditional commerce can’t offer multimedia like videos or virtual try-ons.

## Why It’s Better
Richness makes e-commerce more informative and engaging, helping customers make better choices and increasing trust in the buying process.
