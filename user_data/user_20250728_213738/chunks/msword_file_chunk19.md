Location-Based Commerce (L-Commerce), also known as Location-Based Services (LBS), helps online businesses by using a customer's location (via GPS or similar technology) to offer personalized services, ads, or information in real time. This makes shopping more convenient, increases sales, and improves customer satisfaction. Below, I’ll explain how L-commerce benefits online businesses, its main idea components, and its key applications, using simple language for your exam notes.
