## Comparison to Traditional Commerce

- Traditional stores have limited space for product details (e.g., small tags or brochures) and rely on staff knowledge, which may be inconsistent.
- Price comparisons in physical stores require visiting multiple locations, which is time-consuming.
- Stock updates in traditional stores are slower, and businesses can’t easily track customer preferences.

### Example
In a physical store, you might not know if an item is in stock elsewhere or its full specs without asking staff.

## Why It’s Better
Information density gives customers more data to make smart choices and helps businesses respond quickly to market needs, unlike the limited info in traditional stores.
