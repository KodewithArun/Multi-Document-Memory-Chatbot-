## Structure of L-Commerce Infrastructure (Explained with Simple Vocabulary)

L-commerce works because of a system with six main parts that team up to give you location-based services, like finding a nearby store or getting directions. Below is a simple explanation of each part and how they connect, using easy words.

### 1. Location Finder

- **What it is:** A tool in your phone, like GPS, that knows exactly where you are, like your street or city.
- **What it does:** It finds your spot on the map so businesses can send you stuff related to where you are.

- **Why it’s important:** Without knowing where you are, L-commerce can’t work.
