AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.

Key concepts in AI:

1. **Machine Learning (ML):** Algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
2. **Deep Learning:** A subset of ML using neural networks with many layers to analyze complex data patterns.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables machines to understand and generate human language.
4. **Computer Vision:** Allows computers to interpret and process visual information from the world.
5. **Expert Systems:** AI programs that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts.
6. **Robotics:** Combines AI with mechanical engineering to create intelligent machines that can perform physical tasks.
7. **Reinforcement Learning:** A type of ML where agents learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback.

AI is used in applications like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and more.
