Syntax rules come in two ﬂavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with 3+ = 3$6 is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, 2Zz is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz.

The second type of syntax rule pertains to the structure of a statement; that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement 3+ = 3 is illegal because even though + and = are legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before. Exercise 1.1. Write a well-structured English sentence with invalid tokens in it. Then write an- other sentence with all valid tokens but with invalid structure.
