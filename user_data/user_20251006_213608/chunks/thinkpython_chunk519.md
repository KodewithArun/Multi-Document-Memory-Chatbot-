UML is a rich language with many kinds of diagrams that represent many kinds of rela- tionship between objects and classes. What I presented in this book is a small subset of the language, but it is the subset most commonly used in practice.

The purpose of this appendix is to review the diagrams presented in the previous chapters, and to introduce Lumpy. Lumpy, which stands for “UML in Python,” with some of the letters rearranged, is part of Swampy, which you already installed if you worked on the case study in Chapter 4 or Chapter 19, or if you did Exercise 15.4,

Lumpy uses Python’s inspect module to examine the state of a running program and generate object diagrams (including stack diagrams) and class diagrams.

Here’s an example that uses Lumpy to generate a state diagram.
