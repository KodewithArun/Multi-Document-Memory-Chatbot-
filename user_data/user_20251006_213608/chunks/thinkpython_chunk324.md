Half a bee, philosophically, Must, ipso facto, half not be. But half the bee has got to be Vis a vis, its entity. D’you see?

But can a bee be said to be Or not to be an entire bee When half the bee is not a bee Due to some ancient injury?

13.9. Data structures

In this text, the phrase “half the” is always followed by the word “bee,” but the phrase “the bee” might be followed by either “has” or “is”.

The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each preﬁx (like “half the” and “the bee”) to all possible sufﬁxes (like “has” and “is”).

Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any preﬁx and choos- ing at random from the possible sufﬁxes. Next, you can combine the end of the preﬁx and the new sufﬁx to form the next preﬁx, and repeat.

For example, if you start with the preﬁx “Half a,” then the next word has to be “bee,” because the preﬁx only appears once in the text. The next preﬁx is “a bee,” so the next sufﬁx might be “philosophically,” “be” or “due.”
