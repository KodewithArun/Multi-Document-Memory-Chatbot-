Thanks also to Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections to How to Think Like a Com- puter Scientist.

Thanks to the Free Software Foundation for developing the GNU Free Documentation Li- cense, which helped make my collaboration with Jeff and Chris possible, and Creative Commons for the license I am using now.
