In my opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in school learning to execute algorithms that, quite literally, require no intelligence.

On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting, intellectually chal- lenging, and a central part of what we call programming.

Some of the things that people do naturally, without difﬁculty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form of an algorithm.

7.7 Debugging

As you start writing bigger programs, you might ﬁnd yourself spending more time debug- ging. More code means more chances to make an error and more place for bugs to hide.

One way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection.” For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.
