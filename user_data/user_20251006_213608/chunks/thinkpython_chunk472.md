Appendix A. Debugging

If you are building the program incrementally, you should have a good idea about where the error is. It will be in the last line you added.

If you are copying code from a book, start by comparing your code to the bookâ€™s code very carefully. Check every character. At the same time, remember that the book might be wrong, so if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.

Here are some ways to avoid the most common syntax errors:

1. Make sure you are not using a Python keyword for a variable name.

2. Check that you have a colon at the end of the header of every compound statement, including for, while, if, and def statements.

3. Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks.
