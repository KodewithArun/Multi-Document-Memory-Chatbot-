There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “as- sembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low- level languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.

The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modi- ﬁcations. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewrit- ten to run on another.
