print

’

Hello, World!

’

This is an example of a print statement, which doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the words

Hello, World!

The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be dis- played; they don’t appear in the result.

In Python 3, the syntax for printing is slightly different:

print(

’

Hello, World!

’

)

The parentheses indicate that print is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3.

For the rest of this book, I’ll use the print statement. If you are using Python 3, you will have to translate. But other than that, there are very few differences we have to worry about.

It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the examples as you go. You can run most of the examples in interactive mode, but if you put the code in a script, it is easier to try out variations.
