Now I’m going to give you an example that doesn’t work. Let’s look at the ﬁve-letter word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the ﬁrst letter, I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.

But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the ﬁrst two letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what’s the word?

You can use the dictionary from Exercise 11.1 to check whether a string is in the word list.
