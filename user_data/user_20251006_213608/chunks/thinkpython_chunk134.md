Exercise 4.4. The letters of the alphabet can be constructed from a moderate number of basic ele- ments, like vertical and horizontal lines and a few curves. Design a font that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic elements and then write functions that draw letters of the alphabet.

You should write one function for each letter, with names draw_a, draw_b, etc., and put your functions in a ﬁle named letters.py. You can download a “turtle typewriter” from http:// thinkpython.com/code/typewriter.py to help you test your code.
