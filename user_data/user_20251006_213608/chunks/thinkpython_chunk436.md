5. When you are convinced that your classiﬁcation methods are working, the next step is to esti- mate the probabilities of the various hands. Write a function in PokerHand.py that shufﬂes a deck of cards, divides it into hands, classiﬁes the hands, and counts the number of times various classiﬁcations appear.

6. Print a table of the classiﬁcations and their probabilities. Run your program with larger and larger numbers of hands until the output values converge to a reasonable degree of accu- racy. Compare your results to the values at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_ rankings.
