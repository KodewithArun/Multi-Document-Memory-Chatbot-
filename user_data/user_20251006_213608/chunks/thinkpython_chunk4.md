What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I published the ﬁrst Python version in 2001.

In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the ﬁrst time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.

I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for ﬁnding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pit- falls.
