The correct ordering for cards is not obvious. For example, which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher rank, but the other has a higher suit. In order to compare cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.

With that decided, we can write __cmp__:

# suits are the same... check ranks if self.rank > other.rank: return 1 if self.rank < other.rank: return -1

# ranks are the same... it return 0

You can write this more concisely using tuple comparison:

# inside class Card:

def __cmp__(self, other):
