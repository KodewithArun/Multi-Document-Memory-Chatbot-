Jason Mader at George Washington University made a number of useful suggestions and cor- rections.

Jan Gundtofte-Bruun reminded us that “a error” is an error.

Abel David and Alexis Dinno reminded us that the plural of “matrix” is “matrices”, not “ma- trixes”. This error was in the book for years, but two readers with the same initials reported it on the same day. Weird.

Charles Thayer encouraged us to get rid of the semi-colons we had put at the ends of some statements and to clean up our use of “argument” and “parameter”.

Roger Sperberg pointed out a twisted piece of logic in Chapter 3.

Sam Bull pointed out a confusing paragraph in Chapter 2.

Andrew Cheung pointed out two instances of “use before def.”

C. Corey Capel spotted the missing word in the Third Theorem of Debugging and a typo in Chapter 4.

Alessandra helped clear up some Turtle confusion.

Wim Champagne found a brain-o in a dictionary example.

Douglas Wright pointed out a problem with ﬂoor division in arc.
