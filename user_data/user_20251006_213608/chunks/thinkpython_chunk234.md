Chapter 10

Lists

10.1 A list is a sequence

Like a string, a list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called elements or sometimes items.

There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets ([ and ]): [10, 20, 30, 40] , crunchy frog [

ram bladder

,

lark vomit

]

The ﬁrst example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements of a list don’t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a ﬂoat, an integer, and (lo!) another list:

[

spam

, 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]

A list within another list is nested.

A list that contains no elements is called an empty list; you can create one with empty brackets, [].

As you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:
