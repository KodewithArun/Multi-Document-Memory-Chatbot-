The star (*) near the arrow head is a multiplicity; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has. A multiplicity can be a simple number, like 52, a range, like 5..7 or a star, which indicates that a Deck can have any number of Cards.

A more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a list of Cards, but built-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams. Exercise 18.4. Read TurtleWorld.py, World.py and Gui.py and draw a class diagram that shows the relationships among the classes deÔ¨Åned there.
