5.9 Stack diagrams for recursive functions

In Section 3.10, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a func- tion call. The same kind of diagram can help interpret a recursive function.

Every time a function gets called, Python creates a new function frame, which contains the functionâ€™s local variables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on the stack at the same time.

Figure 5.1 shows a stack diagram for countdown called with n = 3.

As usual, the top of the stack is the frame for __main__. It is empty because we did not create any variables in __main__ or pass any arguments to it.
