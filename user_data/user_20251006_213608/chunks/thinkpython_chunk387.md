17.1 Object-oriented features

Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it provides fea- tures that support object-oriented programming.

It is not easy to deﬁne object-oriented programming, but we have already seen some of its characteristics:

Programs are made up of object deﬁnitions and function deﬁnitions, and most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.

Each object deﬁnition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world, and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.
