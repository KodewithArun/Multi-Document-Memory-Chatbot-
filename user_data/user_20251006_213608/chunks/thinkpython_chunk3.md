Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.

Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and deﬁne each term at ﬁrst use.

Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difﬁcult topics and split them into a series of small steps.

Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.

I needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.

My ﬁrst version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.

I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.
