lumpy.object_diagram()

The ﬁrst line imports the Lumpy class from swampy.Lumpy. If you don’t have Swampy installed as a package, make sure the Swampy ﬁles are in Python’s search path and use this import statement instead:

from Lumpy import Lumpy

The next lines create a Lumpy object and make a “reference” point, which means that Lumpy records the objects that have been deﬁned so far.

Next we deﬁne new variables and invoke object_diagram, which draws the objects that have been deﬁned since the reference point, in this case message, n and pi.
