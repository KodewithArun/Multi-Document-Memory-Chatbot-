I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects. And I wrote solutions for most of them.

I added a series of case studiesâ€”longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion. Some are based on Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for use in my classes. Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from http://thinkpython.com.

I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.

I added appendices about debugging, analysis of algorithms, and UML diagrams with Lumpy.

I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.
