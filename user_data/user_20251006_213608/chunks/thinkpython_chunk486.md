Is a section of code producing an effect that is not what you expected? Make sure that you understand the code in question, especially if it involves invocations to functions or methods in other Python modules. Read the documentation for the functions you invoke. Try them out by writing simple test cases and checking the results.

In order to program, you need to have a mental model of how programs work. If you write a program that doesn’t do what you expect, very often the problem is not in the program; it’s in your mental model.

A.3. Semantic errors

The best way to correct your mental model is to break the program into its components (usually the functions and methods) and test each component independently. Once you ﬁnd the discrepancy between your model and reality, you can solve the problem.
