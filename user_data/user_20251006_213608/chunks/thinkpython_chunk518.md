Section 10.2 shows what a list looks like in a state diagram, Section 11.4 shows what a dictionary looks like, and Section 12.6 shows two ways to represent tuples.

Section 15.2 introduces object diagrams, which show the state of an object’s attributes, and their attributes, and so on. Section 15.3 has object diagrams for Rectangles and their em- bedded Points. Section 16.1 shows the state of a Time object. Section 18.2 has a diagram that includes a class object and an instance, each with their own attributes.

Finally, Section 18.8 introduces class diagrams, which show the classes that make up a program and the relationships between them.

These diagrams are based on the Uniﬁed Modeling Language (UML), which is a stan- dardized graphical language used by software engineers to communicate about program design, especially for object-oriented programs.
