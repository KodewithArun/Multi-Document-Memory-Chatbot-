Remember, the goal is not just to make the program work. The goal is to learn how to make the program work.

Appendix B

Analysis of Algorithms

This appendix is an edited excerpt from Think Complexity, by Allen B. Downey, also published by Oâ€™Reilly Media (2011). When you are done with this book, you might want to move on to that one.

Analysis of algorithms is a branch of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms, especially their run time and space requirements. See http://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms.

The practical goal of algorithm analysis is to predict the performance of different algo- rithms in order to guide design decisions.
