It is not easy to deﬁne an algorithm. It might help to start with something that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized In effect, you memorized 100 speciﬁc solutions. That kind of the multiplication table. knowledge is not algorithmic.

But if you were “lazy,” you probably cheated by learning a few tricks. For example, to ﬁnd the product of n and 9, you can write n − 1 as the ﬁrst digit and 10 − n as the second digit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That’s an algorithm!

Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrow- ing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.
