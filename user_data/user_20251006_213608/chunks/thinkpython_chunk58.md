Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for speciÔ¨Åc applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal lan- guage to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:

Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.

Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, 3 + 3 = 6 is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but 3+ = 3$6 is not. H2O is a syntactically correct chemical formula, but 2Zz is not.
