understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.

Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages). First, re- member that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small er- rors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.

1.5 The ﬁrst program

Traditionally, the ﬁrst program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” be- cause all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this:

print

’

Hello, World!
