Write a function call that passes bob as an argument to square, and then run the program again.

2. Add another parameter, named length, to square. Modify the body so length of the sides is length, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for length.

3. The functions lt and rt make 90-degree turns by default, but you can provide a second argument that speciÔ¨Åes the number of degrees. For example, lt(bob, 45) turns bob 45 degrees to the left. Make a copy of square and change the name to polygon. Add another parameter named n and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees.

4. Write a function called circle that takes a turtle, t, and radius, r, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by invoking polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of r.
