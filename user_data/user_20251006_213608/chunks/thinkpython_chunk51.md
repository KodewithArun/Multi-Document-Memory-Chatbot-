1.2 What is a program?

A program is a sequence of instructions that speciﬁes how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or ﬁnding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as search- ing and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:

input: Get data from the keyboard, a ﬁle, or some other device.

output: Display data on the screen or send data to a ﬁle or other device.

math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.

conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.

repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
