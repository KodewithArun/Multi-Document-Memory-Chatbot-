Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you downloaded, skip over the header information at the beginning of the ﬁle, and process the rest of the words as before.

Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book, and the number of times each word is used.

Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different books by different authors, written in different eras. Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary? Exercise 13.3. Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the 20 most frequently-used words in the book. Exercise 13.4. Modify the previous program to read a word list (see Section 9.1) and then print all the words in the book that are not in the word list. How many of them are typos? How many of them are common words that should be in the word list, and how many of them are really obscure?
