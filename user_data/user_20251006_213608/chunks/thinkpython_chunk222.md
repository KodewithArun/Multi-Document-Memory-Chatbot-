9.2 Exercises

There are solutions to these exercises in the next section. You should at least attempt each one before you read the solutions. Exercise 9.2. In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called Gadsby that does not contain the letter “e.” Since “e” is the most common letter in English, that’s not easy to do.

In fact, it is difﬁcult to construct a solitary thought without using that most common symbol. It is slow going at ﬁrst, but with caution and hours of training you can gradually gain facility.

All right, I’ll stop now.

Write a function called has_no_e that returns True if the given word doesn’t have the letter “e” in it.

Modify your program from the previous section to print only the words that have no “e” and com- pute the percentage of the words in the list have no “e.” Exercise 9.3. Write a function named avoids that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and that returns True if the word doesn’t use any of the forbidden letters.
