11.1 Dictionary as a set of counters

Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:

1. You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could tra- verse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, proba- bly using a chained conditional.

2. You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function ord), use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.

11.2. Looping and dictionaries

3. You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the correspond- ing values. The Ô¨Årst time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.

Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that computation in a different way.
