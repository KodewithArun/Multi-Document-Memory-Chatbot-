key-value pair: The representation of the mapping from a key to a value.

item: Another name for a key-value pair.

key: An object that appears in a dictionary as the ﬁrst part of a key-value pair.

value: An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is

more speciﬁc than our previous use of the word “value.”

implementation: A way of performing a computation.

hashtable: The algorithm used to implement Python dictionaries.

hash function: A function used by a hashtable to compute the location for a key.

hashable: A type that has a hash function. Immutable types like integers, ﬂoats and strings

are hashable; mutable types like lists and dictionaries are not.

lookup: A dictionary operation that takes a key and ﬁnds the corresponding value.

reverse lookup: A dictionary operation that takes a value and ﬁnds one or more keys that

map to it.

singleton: A list (or other sequence) with a single element.
