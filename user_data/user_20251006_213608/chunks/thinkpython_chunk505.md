The performance of dictionaries is one of the minor miracles of computer science. We will see how they work in Section B.4. Exercise B.2. Read the Wikipedia page on sorting algorithms at http://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Sorting_algorithm and answer the following questions:

1. What is a “comparison sort?” What is the best worst-case order of growth for a comparison sort? What is the best worst-case order of growth for any sort algorithm?

2. What is the order of growth of bubble sort, and why does Barack Obama think it is “the wrong way to go?”

3. What is the order of growth of radix sort? What preconditions do we need to use it?

4. What is a stable sort and why might it matter in practice?

5. What is the worst sorting algorithm (that has a name)?

6. What sort algorithm does the C library use? What sort algorithm does Python use? Are these algorithms stable? You might have to Google around to ﬁnd these answers.
