A.1.1

I keep making changes and it makes no difference.

If the interpreter says there is an error and you don’t see it, that might be because you and the interpreter are not looking at the same code. Check your programming environment to make sure that the program you are editing is the one Python is trying to run.

If you are not sure, try putting an obvious and deliberate syntax error at the beginning of the program. Now run it again. If the interpreter doesn’t ﬁnd the new error, you are not running the new code.

There are a few likely culprits:

You edited the ﬁle and forgot to save the changes before running it again. Some programming environments do this for you, but some don’t.

You changed the name of the ﬁle, but you are still running the old name.

Something in your development environment is conﬁgured incorrectly.
