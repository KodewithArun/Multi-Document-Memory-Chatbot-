Chapter 1. The way of the program

1.3.2 Runtime errors

The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.

Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the ﬁrst few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.

1.3.3 Semantic errors

The third type of error is the semantic error. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Speciﬁcally, it will do what you told it to do.
