There is a mismatch between the items in a format string and the items passed for conversion. This can happen if either the number of items does not match or an invalid conversion is called for.

You are passing the wrong number of arguments to a function or method. For methods, look at the method deﬁnition and check that the ﬁrst parameter is self. Then look at the method invocation; make sure you are invoking the method on an object with the right type and providing the other arguments correctly.

KeyError: You are trying to access an element of a dictionary using a key that the dictio-

nary does not contain.

AttributeError: You are trying to access an attribute or method that does not exist. Check

the spelling! You can use dir to list the attributes that do exist.
