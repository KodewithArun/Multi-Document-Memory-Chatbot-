You can read about this problem at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox, and you can download my solution from http://thinkpython.com/code/birthday.py. Exercise 10.9. Write a function called remove_duplicates that takes a list and returns a new list with only the unique elements from the original. Hint: they don’t have to be in the same order. Exercise 10.10. Write a function that reads the ﬁle words.txt and builds a list with one element per word. Write two versions of this function, one using the append method and the other using the idiom t = t + [x]. Which one takes longer to run? Why?

Hint: use the time module to measure elapsed time. Solution: http://thinkpython.com/ code/wordlist.py. Exercise 10.11. To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use the in operator, but it would be slow because it searches through the words in order.
