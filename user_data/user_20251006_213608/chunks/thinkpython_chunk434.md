18.12 Exercises

Exercise 18.6. The following are the possible hands in poker, in increasing order of value (and decreasing order of probability):

pair: two cards with the same rank

two pair: two pairs of cards with the same rank

three of a kind: three cards with the same rank

straight: ﬁve cards with ranks in sequence (aces can be high or low, so Ace-2-3-4-5 is a straight

and so is 10-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, but Queen-King-Ace-2-3 is not.)

ﬂush: ﬁve cards with the same suit

full house: three cards with one rank, two cards with another

four of a kind: four cards with the same rank

straight ﬂush: ﬁve cards in sequence (as deﬁned above) and with the same suit

The goal of these exercises is to estimate the probability of drawing these various hands.
