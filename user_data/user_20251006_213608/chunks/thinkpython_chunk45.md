Chapter 1

The way of the program

The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of think- ing combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (speciÔ¨Å- cally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into sys- tems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behav- ior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.
