Solution: http://thinkpython.com/code/ImageBrowser.py. Exercise 19.5. A vector graphics editor is a program that allows users to draw and edit shapes on the screen and generate output ﬁles in vector graphics formats like Postscript and SVG.

Write a simple vector graphics editor using Tkinter. At a minimum, it should allow users to draw lines, circles and rectangles, and it should use Canvas.dump to generate a Postscript description of the contents of the Canvas.

As a challenge, you could allow users to select and resize items on the Canvas. Exercise 19.6. Use Tkinter to write a basic web browser. It should have a Text widget where the user can enter a URL and a Canvas to display the contents of the page.

You can use the urllib module to download ﬁles (see Exercise 14.6) and the HTMLParser module to parse the HTML tags (see http://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html).
