2. Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths, converts them to integers, and uses is_triangle to check whether sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle.

The following exercises use TurtleWorld from Chapter 4: Exercise 5.5. Read the following function and see if you can Ô¨Ågure out what it does. Then run it (see the examples in Chapter 4).

Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion

Figure 5.2: A Koch curve.

def draw(t, length, n):

if n == 0: return angle = 50 fd(t, length*n) lt(t, angle) draw(t, length, n-1) rt(t, 2*angle) draw(t, length, n-1) lt(t, angle) bk(t, length*n)

Exercise 5.6. The Koch curve is a fractal that looks something like Figure 5.2. To draw a Koch curve with length x, all you have to do is

1. Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.

2. Turn left 60 degrees.

3. Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.

4. Turn right 120 degrees.

5. Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.

6. Turn left 60 degrees.

7. Draw a Koch curve with length x/3.
