Chapter 9

Case study: word play

9.1 Reading word lists

For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words. There are lots of word lists available on the Web, but the one most suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists collected and contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby lexi- con project (see http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project). It is a list of 113,809 ofﬁcial crosswords; that is, words that are considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games. In the Moby collection, the ﬁlename is 113809of.fic; you can download a copy, with the simpler name words.txt, from http://thinkpython.com/code/words.txt.
