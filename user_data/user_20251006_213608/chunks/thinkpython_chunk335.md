Exercise 13.9. The “rank” of a word is its position in a list of words sorted by frequency: the most common word has rank 1, the second most common has rank 2, etc.

Zipf’s law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies of words in natural languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf’s_law). Speciﬁcally, it predicts that the frequency, f, of the word with rank r is:

f = cr−s

where s and c are parameters that depend on the language and the text. If you take the logarithm of both sides of this equation, you get:

log f = logc − slogr
