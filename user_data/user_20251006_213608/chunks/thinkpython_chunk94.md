3.5 Adding new functions

So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A function deﬁnition speciﬁes the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.

Here is an example:

def print_lyrics():

’

’

print "I print "I sleep all night and I work all day."

m a lumberjack, and I

m okay."

def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function deﬁnition. The name of the function is print_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the ﬁrst character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.

The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any argu- ments.
