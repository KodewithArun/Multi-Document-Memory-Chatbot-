Or you could read the documentation of the bisect module and use that! Solution: http:// thinkpython.com/code/inlist.py. Exercise 10.12. Two words are a “reverse pair” if each is the reverse of the other. Write a program that ﬁnds all the reverse pairs in the word list. Solution: http://thinkpython.com/code/ reverse_pair.py. Exercise 10.13. Two words “interlock” if taking alternating letters from each forms a new word. For example, “shoe” and “cold” interlock to form “schooled.” Solution: http:// thinkpython.com/code/interlock.py. Credit: This exercise is inspired by an example at http://puzzlers.org.

1. Write a program that ﬁnds all pairs of words that interlock. Hint: don’t enumerate all pairs!

2. Can you ﬁnd any words that are three-way interlocked; that is, every third letter forms a word, starting from the ﬁrst, second or third?
