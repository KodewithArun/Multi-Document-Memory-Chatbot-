The key aspects of the process are:

1. Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.

2. Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.

3. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difÔ¨Åcult to read.

Exercise 6.2. Use incremental development to write a function called hypotenuse that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the two legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go.

6.3 Composition

As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. This ability is called composition.
