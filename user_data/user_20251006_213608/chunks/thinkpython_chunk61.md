ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using con- textual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.

redundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.

literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor.

If I say, “The penny dropped,” there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone realized something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean exactly what they say.
