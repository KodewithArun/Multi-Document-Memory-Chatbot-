To execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of the ﬁle. If you have a script named dinsdale.py and you are working in a UNIX command window, you type python dinsdale.py. In other development environments, the details of executing scripts are different. You can ﬁnd instructions for your environment at the Python website http: //python.org.

Working in interactive mode is convenient for testing small pieces of code because you can type and execute them immediately. But for anything more than a few lines, you should save your code as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future.
