## 1. Location Finder
- **What it is:** A tool in your phone, like GPS, that knows exactly where you are, like your street or city.
- **What it does:** It finds your spot on the map so businesses can send you stuff related to where you are.
- **Example:** Your phone’s GPS shows you’re at a park, so you get ads for nearby ice cream shops.
- **Why it’s important:** Without knowing where you are, L-commerce can’t work.

## 2. Mobile Positioning Center
- **What it is:** A computer (server) that takes your location info and figures out what to do with it.
- **What it does:** It collects your location from the GPS and tells businesses or apps where you are.
- **Example:** The server sees you’re near a mall and tells a store to send you a sale alert.
- **Why it’s important:** It’s like the brain that organizes your location data.
