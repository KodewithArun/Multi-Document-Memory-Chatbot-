MICROCONTROLLERS MADE EASY by Microcontroller Division Applications

WHAT IS A MICROCONTROLLER?

A few years ago, system control functions were implemented using logic components and were usually large, heavy boxes. Later on, microprocessors were used and the entire con- troller could fit onto a small circuit board. As the process of miniaturization continued, all of the components needed for a controller were built right onto one chip. By only including the fea- tures specific to the task, cost is relatively low.

A typical microcontroller has bit manipulation instructions, easy7 and direct access to I/O, and quick and efficient interrupt processing. Therefore, a microcontroller is a highly integrated device which includes, on one chip, all or most of the parts needed to perform an application control function.
