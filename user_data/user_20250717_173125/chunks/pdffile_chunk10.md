2.1 TIMERS

Watchdog timer. A watchdog timer provides a means of graceful recovery from a system problem. This could be a program that goes into an endless loop, or a hardware problem that prevents the program from operating correctly. If the program fails to reset the watchdog at some predetermined interval, a hardware reset will be initiated. The bug may still exist, but at least the system has a way to recover. This is especially useful for unattended systems.

Auto Reload Timer. Compared to a standard timer, this timer automatically reloads its counting value when the count is over, therefore sparing a waste of CPU resource.
