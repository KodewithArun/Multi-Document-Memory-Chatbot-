CAN & J1850

CAN (Controller Area Network) is a multiplexed wiring scheme that was developed jointly by BOSH and Intel for wiring in automobiles. J1850 is the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) multiplexed automotive wiring standard that is currently in use in North America.

The CAN specification seems to be the one that is being used in industrial control both in North American and Europe. With lower cost microcontrollers that support CAN, CAN has a good potential to take off.
