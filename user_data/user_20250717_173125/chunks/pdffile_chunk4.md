CPU (Central Processing Unit)

It is the brain of the system that processes all data and their travel along the bus. For example, in order to execute a program, the CPU will read the first instruction from program memory. This instruction is decoded by the CPU and executed. At the completion of the execution of the instruction, the next instruction is fetched from memory and is executed. This procedure is repeated until the end of the program (or an endless loop) is found.

TIMERS

The timer or timing system makes it possible to measure and time external and internal events. The power of the timers varies greatly between different MCUs.
