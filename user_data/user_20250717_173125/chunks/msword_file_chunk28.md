# Why E-Commerce is Better

## 1. Ubiquity
- **Definition**: Traditional stores are limited by location (you must visit the shop) and hours (e.g., open 9 AM–9 PM). E-commerce’s ubiquity removes these barriers, allowing instant access, increasing sales, and catering to busy or faraway customers.
- **How It Makes E-Commerce Better**:
- Ubiquity makes e-commerce more convenient and accessible, attracting more customers and enabling businesses to operate without physical or time constraints.
