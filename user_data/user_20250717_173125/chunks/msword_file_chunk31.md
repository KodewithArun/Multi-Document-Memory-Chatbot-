## In-Store Experiences vs. E-Commerce

### Lack of Personalization
- In-store experiences lack personalization (e.g., a salesperson can’t instantly recommend products based on your past purchases).
- Traditional commerce can’t offer multimedia like videos or virtual try-ons.

### Why It’s Better: Richness
- Richness makes e-commerce more informative and engaging, helping customers make better choices and increasing trust in the buying process.

## 3. Information Density

### Definition
- Information density is the large amount of detailed, accurate, and up-to-date information e-commerce platforms can provide about products, prices, and customer preferences, often in real time.
