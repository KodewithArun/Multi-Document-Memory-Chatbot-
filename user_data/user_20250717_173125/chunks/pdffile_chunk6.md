A synchronous bus includes a separate line for the clock signal which simplifies the transmitter and receiver but is more susceptible to noise when used over long distances. With an asyn- chronous bus the transmitter and receiver clocks are independent, and a resynchronization is performed for each byte at the start bit.

A/D CONVERTER

Converts an external analog signal (typically relative to voltage) into a digital representation. Microcontrollers that have this feature can be used for instrumentation, environmental data logging, or any application that lives in an analog world.
