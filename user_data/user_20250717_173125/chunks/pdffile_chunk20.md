Most microcontrollers have at least one external interrupt, which can be edge selectable (rising or falling) or level triggered. Both systems have advantages. Edge is not time sensitive, but it is susceptible to glitches. Level must be held high (or low) for a specific duration (which can be a pain but is not susceptible to glitches).
